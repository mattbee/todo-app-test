# Simply Business Todo App

This is my code test for Simply Business.

## Notes

I've decided to use NextJS as a starting point for the App, to allow me to get started immediately with React and not worry about webpack/babel set up.

## Getting it up and running

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Start the server with `yarn dev`
4. View the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Running tests

To run the end to end cypress tests, run `yarn run cypress open` (assuming the app is running on port 3000).

## Additional plans
